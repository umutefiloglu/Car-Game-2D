## Project Outline
- Every level has 8 stages
- In each stage, you are controlling a car
- Your aim is to reach end without colliding with obstacles and other cars[^1]
[^1]: Up to stage 8; each stage records your path from start to the finish. Next stage, previous cars follow their own path. That means, your previous driven cars will be your enemy through the level.
